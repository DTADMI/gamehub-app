# GameHub Action Plan

Legend: ✅ Completed • 🟡 In Progress • 🔜 Next • 🗂️ Backlog

## Project Overview

GameHub is a Next.js 16 frontend application where users can play web games and browse projects. This repo is
frontend‑only and backend‑agnostic.

---

## Sprint Plan — Dec 2025 (at‑a‑glance)

### ✅ Completed

- Snake: Swipe default with prevent‑scroll; optional Joystick/D‑pad and Taps; pause/resume overlay; HUD
  spacing/typography and color/contrast improvements.
- Memory: On match, cards spin+fade, then become inert placeholders to preserve grid; stable layout verified by E2E.
- E2E: Breakout particles smoke; Systems Discovery BOD smoke; mobile coverage on Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 for Snake.
- Settings/Profiles scaffolding: localStorage‑backed `ProfileProvider`; Settings page with Music/SFX/Particles/Reduced
  Motion.
- Docs: README controls quick‑ref and accessibility guardrails; credits file present with Kenney SFX attribution.

### 🟡 In Progress

- CI health: Monitor the next scheduled CI run on `main` and keep the pipeline green.
- Tests: Maintain mobile Snake spec parity and Memory animation unit test stability.
- Narrative engine fusion: keep canvas `core/*` as primary and integrate `EngineCtx`+`guards/effects`, puzzle primitives
  and React a11y UI (DialogueBox, InventoryBar). Implement first keypad puzzle and wire TME E1.

## TME Episode 1 — Clever Puzzles Plan (approved)

Scope: Apply environmental/diegetic clues and multi-step reasoning to Toymaker Escape E1, leveraging keypad, gears,
wires, pipes, and gesture macros. Maintain a11y parity and reduced-motion.

### Targets

- Keypad: remove inline code from UI; move clues into decor and captions.
- Gears: ratio inferred via environment; tolerate small error; confirm via subtle SFX.
- Wires: enforce no-crossing; pairing hinted via poster and lighting order.
- Pipes: fix leaks; diegetic hissing/decals guide; reduced-motion highlight.
- Hidden latch: require long-press→drag macro.
- Persistence: persist clues and solves in `tme:save:v1`.

### Implementation tasks

- [ ] Update TME E1 scene data to remove overt keypad hint and add decor-based clues.
- [x] Implement wires/connectors logic integration in TME E1 scene. ✓
- [x] Implement pipes/flow logic and minimal UI wrapper; add reduced-motion path (static highlight/text). ✓
- [ ] Extend gears mini with tolerance + decor hint states.
- [x] Extend gears mini with tolerance + decor hint states. ✓
- [x] Register input macro `holdThenDrag` to reveal hidden latch hotspot; update blackboard flags. ✓
- [x] Persist discovered clues/solves in `tme:save:v1`. ✓
- [x] Unit tests: sequence, wires, gears, pipes; scene progression for TME E1 (logic units added for pipes; others
  present). ✓
- [x] Playwright smoke (desktop + Pixel 5) golden path solving at least one optional hint. ✓
- [x] Docs: README section "Designing clever puzzles" and `docs/narrative/scene-puzzles.md` with TME E1 briefs. ✓

### Designer brief — assets & scene description (summary)

- Rooms: Workshop (entry), Shelf Nook, Workbench, Cabinet Wall.
- Key props: Toy shelf (4 sizes/colors), faded ratio plate ("3:1"), wiring board with colored jacks, pipe grid panel
  with valve, scuffed cabinet edge.
- UI labels: EN/FR for posters, captions for alt-hints.
- Audio: faint hiss near leak, soft music box loop varying on solve, subtle latch click.
- VFX (optional): light flicker cue, gentle highlight pulses (reduced-motion replaced by static outline).

Deliverables tracked under Docs & Assets and committed in `docs/narrative/scene-puzzles.md`.

### 🔜 Next

- Profiles/Avatars: expand avatar options (built‑in set + custom URL validation).
- Stats surfaces: surface per‑game stats in UI (sessions, last/high score, best time where applicable).
- Local leaderboard UI: aggregate and render simple local leaderboard per game (with clear “local‑only” badge) and wire
  API seams for future sync.
- Memory assets: add larger/diverse image sets and improve alt text coverage.

### 🗂️ Backlog

- Nightly Playwright job focused on mobile smokes.
- Dependency upgrades and routine tooling bumps when safe.
- Optional: remote‑module loading path for games (CDN + manifest) per README strategy.

  diversify with more memorable, pretty, interesting sets
- D) Assets & public/credits.md — wire Kenney SFX and backgrounds
- E) Documentation updates — Admin/Launcher/Snake/Breakout/Memory + action‑plan update
- F) Profiles & stats — frontend‑only localStorage stubs, plus backend connection seam
- G) Leaderboard — frontend stub + backend seam
- H) Game settings & preferences — frontend UI + local persistence; backend seam
- I) Add user profile and game statistics tracking (frontend-first)
- J) Implement leaderboard functionality (frontend-first)
- K) Implement game settings and preferences (frontend-first)

#### Mode & scope constraints (confirmed)

- CI/E2E: Run Playwright in GitHub Actions on `ubuntu-latest`, Node 20+ (already configured in
  `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`).
- Scope: Frontend changes first. Profiles/stats/leaderboard/settings ship with localStorage stubs and clean seams for
  backend integration when available.

### Current session — Plan to finish up now

Sorted by status

- ✅ Completed
  - A) Breakout — particles reliability and PC controllers (desktop):
    - Reliability: normalized brick‑hit emissions; live switching between `Sparks` and `Puff` takes effect immediately
      via shared settings; particle controls are gated to Breakout only.
    - PC controllers: keyboard Arrows by default; added optional “Mouse control” toggle in the settings strip (off by
      default, does not hijack keyboard).
    - Tests: Playwright smoke for particle controls visibility and live switching; unit tests for settings persistence (
      particles/effect/mode). HUD/boost and pause immobility E2E remain green.
  - Launcher — Local/dev flag for Upcoming play:
    - Implemented env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_UPCOMING_PLAY_LOCAL=true` and an Admin seam flag
      `ui.allowPlayUpcomingLocal` (localStorage) to allow playing Upcoming cards only in dev/local/E2E.
    - Catalog cards show an extra “Dev‑Playable” tag in dev only; production keeps Upcoming cards non‑clickable.
    - Tests: Playwright spec asserts clickability in E2E/dev and non‑clickable in public mode; manifest selector covered
      by unit tests.
  - Systems Discovery BOD Breath deep‑link E2E smoke verified locally; config compatible with CI defaults.
  - Docs updated for BOD packs and designer brief paths include `bod/`.
  - Dev‑utilities scope fixed: reserved for point‑and‑click games only (RoD/SD/TME). Removed Snake‑specific Start New
    Game and dev clear‑data UI; README updated.

- 🟡 In Progress
  - E2E monitoring: ensure CI stays green on `main` with updated Breakout and BOD smoke; watch next scheduled run.

- 🔜 Planned (next actionable steps)
  - B) Snake:
    - Controls: Swipe default; optional Joystick/D‑pad and Taps; prevent page scroll while interacting. (No dev‑only
      clear‑data or Start New Game — those are for point‑and‑click.)
    - UX polish: improve HUD spacing/typography; ensure color/contrast per accessibility best practices; pause overlay
      affordances.
    - Tests: mobile E2E for swipe and one optional controller (Pixel 5 + iPhone 12 profiles).
  - C) Memory:
    - UX: matched cards spin+fade, then remove from DOM while keeping grid placeholders (stable layout/flow).
    - Assets: larger images; diversify sets; improve alt text.
    - Tests: E2E asserts matched pair removal and stable grid; unit test animation completion callback.
  - D) Assets & credits:
    - Wire initial Kenney SFX/backgrounds; update `public/credits.md`.
  - E) Documentation:
    - README/guidelines: Admin/Launcher/Snake/Breakout/Memory controls and settings; reflect particle gating and
      color/contrast guardrails.
  - F–H) Profiles/Leaderboard/Settings (frontend‑first):
    - Implement localStorage‑backed profile store (nickname/avatar), per‑game stats, a simple leaderboard view, and a
      unified settings panel with persistence; add API seams for later backend wiring. Backend connection points are
      prepared but remain stubbed.

Note: README and this action plan will be kept in sync after each milestone; CI lint/test/deploy must stay green.

- Environment configuration is managed through `.env.local`
- Follows semantic versioning for releases

## Recent Updates

- 2025-12-19: Published execution plan for Launcher Phase 2, Admin (frontend‑only), particles reliability, Snake
  controllers, Memory UX, assets/backgrounds, docs, and E2E expansions
- 2025-12-19: Implemented manifest‑driven launcher Phase 1 (manifest + `[slug]` route + catalog wired)
- 2025-12-19: Prioritized new playable MVPs (in order): Knitzy, Bubble Pop, Checkers, Chess. Added detailed tasks to In
  Progress.
- 2025-12-20: Finalized all 7 MVP games as playable and featured in catalog; added E2E smokes for each game and updated
  docs
- 2025-12-21: Added design doc outline for “Rite of Discovery” point-and-click MVP (docs/rite-of-discovery-design.md)
  and
  planned tasks under
  Planned Features → Games; scope includes gentle mode, i18n-ready strings, local save, and E2E coverage.
- 2025-12-22: TME E1 — localized panel/latch/medal UI (EN/FR) and updated E2E to assert medal surfacing after latch
  reveal; wires/pipes panel strings moved to i18n.
- 2025-12-22: TME E1 — added minimal canvas wrapper registering `holdThenDrag` macro; revealing the latch over the
  scuff hotspot now works via canvas or DOM fallback; README updated with E1 Golden Path details.
- 2025-12-21: Post‑MVP roadmap approved for Rite of Discovery (episodes A–D, systems v2, collectibles/journal) and
  designer asset specs appended. Added 12+ “Thinking Tools” extension plan (rationality & biases) with replayable
  vignettes and mastery.
- 2025-12-21: Added bilingual Designer/Animator Brief (EN/FR) with niceness/morality guardrails, fun & replayable 12+
  case
  structures, and full asset specs/checklists. Linked from docs/rite-of-discovery-design.md.
- 2025-12-20: Theming overhaul — galaxy dark + star‑glow light via CSS variables in `app/globals.css`; palette tokens
  defined in requested order and mapped to shadcn semantic tokens for both themes; `--app-bg` drives backgrounds with
  documented light alternatives (cool/minimal). Playwright smoke asserts `body` background-image contains `gradient` in
  both themes. Game cards are fully clickable with preserved accessibility.
- 2025-12-20: Fixed background visibility regression (`:root`), added broad browser FALLBACKs (no oklch/color-mix) so
  backgrounds render everywhere; smoke test validates gradients in both themes. Added plan items: Breakout ball‑color
  change (doc now), advertisement band for non‑subscribers.
- 2025-12-20: Follow-up fix — corrected `:root` selector (typo recovery), re‑asserted
  `body{background-image:var(--app-bg)}`; added explicit verification task under In Progress and awaiting confirmation.
- 2025-12-20: Seamless layout pass — removed heavy borders on home sections, made header/footer translucent, exposed
  galaxy/star‑glow backgrounds; unified card sizing (flex, line‑clamp) for consistent grids.
- 2025-12-20: Featured alignment completed — manifest as single source (Playable == Featured). Home now displays
  Featured Games and Featured Projects only (no Upcoming). Games page badges: Featured (green), Upcoming (yellow).
  Knitzy MVP renamed to Pattern Matching; upcoming Knitzy added; redirect added; E2E updated.
- 2025-12-18: Initial action plan created
- 2025-12-18: Added Breakout and Memory games
